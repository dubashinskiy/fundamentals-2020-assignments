Try to use different launch modes for four presented activities:
WS01Step02ActivityA, WS01Step02ActivityB, WS01Step02ActivityC and WS01Step02ActivityD

For change launch mode of activity you can change tag "launchMode" in the AndroidManifest.xml
as shown below

<activity
     android:name=".workshop01.step02.WS01Step02ActivityD"
     android:label="@string/ws01_step02_activity_d_title"
     android:launchMode="standard"/>

In tag key "launchMode" you can set:
- "standard"
- "singleTop"
- "singleTask"
- "singleInstance"

Try to use each of it and analyze lifecycle of Activities. Logs for lifecycle has been already added :)

Also for the launchMode "singleInstance" try to add tag "taskAffinity" like shown below and open the
task manager (Recent launched apps) in your phone

<activity
     android:name=".workshop01.step02.WS01Step02ActivityD"
     android:label="@string/ws01_step02_activity_d_title"
     android:taskAffinity=".workshop01.step02.WS01Step02ActivityD_task"
     android:launchMode="standard"/>
